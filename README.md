## Setup
Ffau editor will not work without its libraries. The best way to get all off this data at once is to grab the latest release version from the Github repo. You can use the 'Download ZIP' button, or use git from the command line to clone the repository if you know how. For most users, a ZIP download will work just fine.

To successfully use Ffau, place all files on this repo on any web server and navigate to index.html
Please note Ffau is constantly being improved - especially new blocks being added, but also changes to the UI. We recommend you regularly update Ffau to receive the best experience.

Alternatively, you may visit https://codeddraig.github.io/ffau/ in any modern web browser to use a demo of the software.

## Export
Ffau can save your blocks to a text file in the browser (with the extension '.txt') and import them to re-assemble your blocks. Files exported from Ffau can be imported to CodeDragon (http://codedragon.codei0.net/), and vice-versa.

## Bugs
To report problems or potential additions, please feel free to visit the 'issues' section of this repo. For security issues, please email us at: **ffau [at] codei0 [dot] net**.

## Libraries
This project would not be possible without the following amazing libraries. We are much indebted to them for their support and work:

### jQuery (http://jquery.com/)
The JavaScript library which handles DOM transversals and event handling with far more grace and ease than pure JavaScript. It is also a requirement for other libraries used in this project.

### Blockly by Google (https://github.com/google/blockly)
A magic library which you should have heard of by now. It creates the whole drag-and-drop block system, which is the basis for this entire system!

### Magic.css by Pal Kerecsenyi (https://github.com/palkerecsenyi/magic)
CSS library for everything but the editor itself. Developed by one of our own team!

### Ace Editor (https://ace.c9.io/)
Handles syntax highlighting in the "Real Code" tab.

### Music by Kevin MacLeod (http://incompetech.com)
"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy", "Monkeys Spinning Monkeys", "Pixelland" - (Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/))

### Video by the Open Movie Foundation (http://blender.org)
**Trailer for "Big Buck Bunny"** and **"Llama Drama, Episode 1"**.

## Inspiration
Our project is inspired by, but not a direct clone of, the blockly-html project (https://github.com/bwinf/blockly-html) by the BWNIF (Bundesweit Informatik Nachwuchs FÃ¶rdern), a German organisation which seeks to further development in Computer Science among children. Also, we owe some of our inspiration to the EduBlocks project (https://github.com/AllAboutCode/EduBlocks) by Joshua Lowe, which performs a similar function to our work, but for Python, rather than the web.
